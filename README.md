# Aim:
To perform the Exploration of Prompting Techniques for Video Generation
# Algorithm: 
1. Explore AI models capable of video generation such as Runway Gen-2, Make-A-Video, and Imagen Video.
2. Create simple prompts describing basic scenes.
3. Create detailed prompts with rich descriptions including environment, lighting, and motion.
4. Generate videos using the prompts on selected AI tools.
5. Compare and analyze the quality, coherence, and style of videos generated by different prompts and models.
6. Refine prompts based on output evaluation for improved video generation.
   
# Procedure:
1. Familiarize yourself with video generation tools: Runway Gen-2, Make-A-Video, and Imagen Video.
2. Design a simple prompt: "A bird flying over a calm lake."
3. Generate video with the simple prompt on Runway Gen-2 to observe basic animation and motion.
4. Design a detailed prompt: "A vibrant sunset over a mountain range with clouds drifting slowly and a river reflecting the golden sky."
5. Generate video with the detailed prompt on Imagen Video and Make-A-Video to observe enhanced visuals and smooth transitions.
6. Compare results from simple and detailed prompts for differences in detail, motion, and realism.
7. Iterate prompt design to improve output based on observation.

# Output:
1. Simple Prompt: "A bird flying over a calm lake."
